# Loss Functions in Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of common **loss functions** used in machine learning:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – measures the average magnitude of errors.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – measures the squared difference between predicted and actual values.  
- **Log Loss / Binary Cross-Entropy** – commonly used for binary classification tasks.
